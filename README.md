# mashup-poca (2025)
Frontend project that connects to Guardian v3, a bot running in the [95 Degrees community Discord server](https://95degrees.cafe), and receives incoming messages from a specified text channel, which can be displayed in various forms such as small popup messages and full screen highlighted messages.

This system was created for the [95 LIVE](https://wiki.95degrees.cafe/95_LIVE) 2025 broadcast run by ThisIsntNath, a yearly event celebrating the 95 Degrees community. 

The messages that were displayed by this system were shown in the broadcast during the half hour pre-show before the main broadcast, with pop-ups accompanying the pre-rendered visuals created by Nath, and full screen messages being displayed separately.

Backend management for this system was handled by Guardian in a separate private text channel.
